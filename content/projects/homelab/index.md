## Home Lab 🏠💻  

Welcome to my **Home Lab**! This is where I experiment with **Kubernetes, GitOps, automation, and security** while refining my skills in **DevOps and infrastructure management**.  

## 🔹 About This Lab  

My home lab is designed to:  
✅ Test and deploy **self-hosted applications** securely.  
✅ Explore **GitOps workflows** for managing infrastructure.  
✅ Improve **Kubernetes automation** and monitoring.  
✅ Experiment with **DevSecOps and security best practices**.  

## 🔹 Projects & Documentation  

Below are the key topics I’ve documented from my home lab setup. Each link takes you to a detailed breakdown of the implementation, challenges, and lessons learned.

## 🔹 Why I Document This  

Technology is **constantly evolving**, and this lab allows me to **experiment, break things, and learn from them**. By documenting my work, I:  
📌 Keep track of what I’ve built and improved.  
📌 Help others who are exploring similar setups.  
📌 Build a **portfolio** showcasing real-world expertise.  

I’ll keep updating this section with **new projects and insights** as I continue learning. If you're interested in DevOps, Kubernetes, and automation, stay tuned!
