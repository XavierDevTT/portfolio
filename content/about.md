Iâ€™ve implemented **infrastructure automation**, optimized **CI/CD pipelines**, and led **enterprise IT transformations** across Windows and Linux environments. My work focuses on **security, observability, and reliability**, ensuring seamless deployments and efficient system operations.  

Beyond engineering, Iâ€™m dedicated to **sharing knowledge** through technical content, open-source contributions, and hands-on projects. When Iâ€™m not working with tech, Iâ€™m exploring **real estate investing** and **entrepreneurship** as part of my long-term goals.  

This website showcases my **projects, insights, and experiences**â€”a digital space where I document my journey in **IT, automation, and beyond**.  

Letâ€™s connect and build the future of infrastructure together. ðŸš€
