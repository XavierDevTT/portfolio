## Welcome to My Tech Journey ðŸš€  

Hi there! Iâ€™m **Darnell Xavier** but you can call me **Xavier**, a **Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)** and **IT Infrastructure Engineer** with a passion for **automation, DevOps, and cloud-native technologies**.  

I created this site to **share my journey, projects, and insights** into Kubernetes, DevOps, infrastructure automation, and security. Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked on deploying and managing **Kubernetes clusters, implementing GitOps workflows, and optimizing CI/CD pipelines** to improve system reliability and efficiency.  

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here  

This website will be a space where I document:  

- **Technical deep dives** into Kubernetes, GitOps, and automation.  
- **Hands-on projects** showcasing real-world implementations.  
- **Lessons learned** from working in IT infrastructure and DevOps.  
- **Career insights** for those looking to break into the field.  

## Why Iâ€™m Doing This  

Technology is constantly evolving, and I believe in **continuous learning and sharing knowledge**. My goal is to create content that helps others navigate the world of cloud-native technologies while also serving as a personal archive of my work and growth.  

If youâ€™re interested in **Kubernetes, automation, and IT infrastructure**, stick around! You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/XavierDevTT), where I contribute to open-source projects and share code.  

Letâ€™s build something great together! ðŸš€
